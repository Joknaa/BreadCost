database's name is: chat_db
I'm using MySQL for storing data
Here is a guide how to restore the database:
- open your MySQL Workbench
- In menu bar, click to icon "create a new schema..."
- In name box, type: "chat_db"
- click Apply
- Now you have your new database name "chat_db". Double click to that database in schema section
- now paste the code from the chat_db.sql file and run it!
- done!

How to run:
- You should open this project using Netbeans IDE (not Eclipse)
- Firstly run server: ServerFrame.java
- Then run ClientFrame.java. Each user will run one ClientFrame
- Login and see how it work!
Thank you!
